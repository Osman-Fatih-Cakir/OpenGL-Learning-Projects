NOTE: In order to run the project, you have to change the solution platform to x86

I have learnt about these topics in this project:

- Cubemap
- Environment Mapping

Outputs:
<img src="./OUTPUTS/reflection.gif" width="800" height="450" />  
<img src="./OUTPUTS/refraction.gif" width="800" height="450" />  
<img src="./OUTPUTS/refraction_index.gif" width="800" height="450" />  

In this project I used
- "learnopengl.com" site for documentation. Some code lines on the site may be occur also in my project too.
